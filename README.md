# Arsl_sign_to_text_sic_final (#team 106)
## Overview
This project aims to bridge communication gaps for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals by creating an Arabic Sign Language to Text Translator. It utilizes deep learning techniques, including CNN1D, CNN and VGG models, to convert Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) into text. With the goal of making sign language translation more accessible and affordable, we also provide character-based translation and web deployment for user-friendly access.

## Features
#### ArSL to Text Translation: Translate Arabic Sign Language gestures into text for improved communication access for DHH individuals.

#### Character-Based Translation: Convert Arabic Sign Language characters into text to enhance communication and understanding.

#### Web Deployment: Deploy the model on a website to make the translation service easily accessible to everyone.

#### Dataset: Utilize a dataset of Arabic Sign Language videos and character images for training.
